Here we apply the method of computational textual analysis known as 'topic modeling' to a philosophy of science corpus consisting of the full-text content of 16917 articles published by eight philosophy of science journals from the 1934 up until 2017. 

These journals, which are among the most recognized journals that publish general philosophy of science research, include: 
*the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science*, 
*the European Journal for the Philosophy of Science*, Erkenntnis, 
*International Studies in Philosophy of Science*, 
*Journal for General Philosophy of Science*, 
*Philosophy of Science*, 
*Studies in History and Philosophy of Science (Part A)*, 
*and Synthese*. 

To access the content of some of the earlier publications sometimes written in German, Dutch or French, we used machine translation to constitute an English-only working corpus. 
Though largely imperfect, especially syntactically, these translations are nevertheless sufficient for 'bag-of-word' approaches such as topic-modeling. 
We then applied the well-known LDA topic model with Gibbs sampling, and carried out diachronic analyses (for more on the methodology, please see the references below).

The results of our analyses document, in particular, the shift in topics in the philosophy of science, with a relative decrease of philosophy of language, logic and philosophy of physics articles over eighty years, and an increase in epistemology, philosophy of biology and of mind. 
Such quantitative data offer an empirical basis for what might otherwise be informal claims about the discipline and its evolution in the past eight decades as reconstructed from the perspective of its major journals. 
They are also the type of data that may trigger novel discussions about the directions the field might take.
