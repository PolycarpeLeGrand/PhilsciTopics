This website makes it possible to explore the different topics, their keywords and the articles in which they are present. 
Formally, topics that result from topic-modeling computational approaches - such as the one we implemented here - are probability distributions over words. 
The semantic content of topics can thus be inferred by examining the words that have the highest probabilities to be present in a given topic. 
We have attributed meaningful labels to topics in this way. The methods also make it possible to retrieve the documents in which the topics are the most probable. 
Examining these documents also helps in inferring the semantic content of topics. 

The topic model includes 25 topics that we subsequently grouped into 8 broader categories (A through H) based on our best judgment and knowledge of the field. 
These categories are convenient for handling the diversity of topics, yet, one should always bear in mind that categories are not the result of the computational topic-modeling work: 
what really matters, for analyses, are the topics themselves. 

Browsing on the website, one can view the detailed content of each topic, as well as the articles in which topics are the most probable. 
Diachronic views are also available that reveal topic trends over time.
